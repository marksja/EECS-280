Repo for EECS 280 Projects

This is so we can actually work on the project together, so when you've already done half the project and started testing, I can tell what you did and don't have to spend an hour trying to figure out what still needs completion.

It'd be cool if you could upload your current Euchre file and the .cpp and .h files here. [March 11 2015]
